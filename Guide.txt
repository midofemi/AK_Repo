#To use Conda, Git Bash and VS Code altogether. You need to make sure these apps are on the path for the environmental variable in your PC
#Here we are using Git bash because we want to work with Git 
1. FIRST, you need to create a git project on github
2. Clone the repo you just created on github
3. Create your folders
- mkdir utils # We are telling our project or virtual environment to make a directory called utils 
- Inside utils, we can make a py file called __init__.py where we will be having our package of script we write for our Code
- Inide utils again, we can create as many python file for our project. Eg: and.py (and operation), or.py (or operations) etc
- Inside, utils, we can create a python file called all_utils.py where we will be registering our helper functions
- AND SO ON IF YOU NEED ANY OTHER FILE, JUST Create
4. Next we can creare our libraies with a text file
- touch requirements.txt
Inside this txt file, we can have our neccessary libraies for our project
But before we execute our requirement.txt. We need to create a virtual environment
 - conda create -n <NAME OF VIRTUAL ENV>
 - source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
 - conda activate <NAME OF VIRTUAL ENV>
5. Run your libraries
- pip install -r requirement.txt

GIT
To add changes or code you have added to your project to github or main repository. First, you need to stage those changes and then commit
 - git add . #This means, add all these changes to the staging area
 - git commit -m "first commit. We copied the functions on anaconda to VS environment" 
THEN Push the commit and changes to the repo
 - git push origin main #Now push everything to main branch

NOW, if you look at your github. All the changes you commit and push will be on your github to view
